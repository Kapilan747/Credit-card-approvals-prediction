# Predicting Credit Card Approvals

This project focuses on predicting credit card approval outcomes based on various applicant attributes. Using machine learning techniques, the model aims to evaluate whether a given applicant's profile meets approval requirements.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze and predict credit card approvals using a dataset of applicant profiles. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and applying a machine learning model to make predictions.

## Files in the Repository

- **`notebook.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook containing the entire workflow, including:
  - Data preprocessing and cleaning
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Model training and evaluation

- **`data/your_data_file.csv`**: The dataset used for training and evaluating the model (replace `your_data_file.csv` with the actual file name).

## Requirements

1.To install the required packages, you can run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2.Run the notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb
```
